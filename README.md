## Business Context

Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly affecting children under five years and elderly populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia accounts for a significant percentage of deaths caused by infectious diseases. Early detection and timely treatment are critical to improving patient outcomes, yet current diagnostic methods present challenges.

### The Problem

The most common method for diagnosing pneumonia is through clinical evaluation combined with chest X-ray imaging. However, accurate interpretation of X-rays requires skilled radiologists, whose availability is limited in many regions, especially in rural or resource-constrained healthcare settings. Even when radiologists are available, factors such as:

- **Fatigue**
- **High patient load**
- **Human error**

...can affect the accuracy and consistency of diagnosis. This may lead to delayed treatment, misdiagnosis, or unnecessary use of antibiotics, worsening patient outcomes and straining healthcare systems.

### The Solution

With the advancement of machine learning and deep learning, automated image analysis has emerged as a promising solution to support medical imaging tasks. Leveraging large datasets of chest X-ray images, AI-driven approaches can be trained to recognize pneumonia-related abnormalities in the lungs with high accuracy and consistency. Such systems can serve as decision-support tools for healthcare professionals, reducing diagnostic workload, improving accuracy, and providing timely interventions, particularly in areas with limited medical expertise.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop an intelligent, automated system capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system aims to:

1. **Accurately classify** chest X-ray images into pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative cases
2. **Assist healthcare professionals** by providing a reliable second opinion that reduces diagnostic errors and variability
3. **Improve efficiency** by delivering faster diagnoses, enabling timely treatment, and reducing the burden on radiologists
4. **Enhance accessibility** by offering a scalable solution that can be deployed in hospitals, clinics, or rural healthcare centers with limited resources
5. **Support global health efforts** by contributing to early detection, lowering pneumonia-related mortality rates, and optimizing antibiotic usage

Ultimately, the solution aims to bridge the gap between limited medical expertise and growing healthcare demands, making pneumonia diagnosis more accurate, efficient, and accessible worldwide.

## Data Description

### Dataset Overview

- **Training Images**: 26,684 DICOM files
- **Test Images**: 3,000 DICOM files
- **Format**: DICOM (*.dcm) - Medical image format with metadata and pixel data

### Classification Classes

The dataset contains three classes:

1. **Normal**: Healthy lungs, no abnormalities
2. **No Lung Opacity / Not Normal**: Abnormality present that mimics pneumonia but is not pneumonia
3. **Lung Opacity**: Pneumonia present (with bounding box coordinates for affected regions)

### Data Files

- `stage_2_train_labels.csv`: Contains patient IDs, bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height), and target labels
- `stage_2_detailed_class_info.csv`: Contains patient IDs and detailed class information
- `stage_2_train_images/`: Directory containing training DICOM images
- `stage_2_test_images/`: Directory containing test DICOM images

### Important Notes

Medical images are stored in DICOM files which contain:
- **Header metadata**: Patient information, imaging parameters
- **Pixel data**: Raw image arrays for X-ray visualization

Some patients may have multiple bounding boxes indicating multiple regions of pneumonia.
